# DeviceExample20210114
This is my mod on the DeviceExample sketch from TinyGPSPlus to work with the Heltec ESP32 LoRa.

TinyGPSPlus is great. But it includes the use of SoftwareSerial. ESP32 does not play nice with SoftwareSerial. So I have adapted one of the three ESP32 hardware serial ports instead. See it here in this video:
